Dijkstra's Algorithm

To run Djikstra's Algorithm, you need to follow these steps below:

Installation
  1. Open console
  2. Navigate in console to folder
  3. type in "git clone https://github.com/karthiksriramuoa/ParallelisationGraphAlgorithmsUsingJava.git" and press enter

Exectution
  1. Open eclipse
  2. Set the working directory
  3. Run on eclipse
  4. Input number of vertices and number of threads when prompted

FLoyd's Algorithm

To run FLoyd's Algorithm, you need to follow these steps below:

-> Switch the folder to Karthik's and Kevin's Implementation for Prim's and Floyd's Algorithm

For sequential Execution - 

-> Traverse to src/com/sequential
-> Run the individual executions for Prim's and Floyd's given in independent Java files.
-> Mention the vertices of the graph that you want to enter
-> Measure the time consumed after every execution which is given in the output

For Parallel Execution - 

-> Traverse to src/com/parallel
-> Run the individual executions for Prim's and Floyd's by executing Prims.ptjava and Floyds.ptjava respectively.
-> The corresponding java file is an autogenerated file so should be ignored.
-> Mention the vertices of the graph that you want to enter
-> Measure the time consumed after every execution which is given in the output.

For plotting graphs, we ran this executions of both the versions on Dual Core and Quad Core respectively. The graph is attached in the report.
